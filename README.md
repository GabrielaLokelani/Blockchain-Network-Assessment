# Blockchain-Network-Assessment
Welcome to my personal practical project where I will be building my own blockchain network! 
In this project I will Implement a fully-functional blockchain network consisting of:
Nodes (peer-to-peer communication, blocks, transactions, consensus, REST API),
Mining software (proof-of-work),
Wallet software (handle private keys + sign and send transactions), 
Faucet app (to request free coins) and a 
Block Explorer app (to browse the blocks and transactions).

Lets get this Meowchain going, don't stop meowing!!!
